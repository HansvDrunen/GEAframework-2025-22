# GEA Framework App

This repository contains the implementation, research, and demo materials for the **GEA Framework App**, a project focused on extracting, classifying, and analysing GEA-related statements (Mission, Vision, Strategy, Core Values, and Goals) from company data sources.

The project combines data analysis, NLP-based modeling, and an interactive Streamlit demo to showcase the end-to-end workflow.
